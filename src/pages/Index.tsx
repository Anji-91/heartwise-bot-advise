  `Here are essential communication techniques that can transform your relationship:

1. Practice Active Listening
   - Give your full attention when your partner speaks
   - Maintain eye contact and put away distractions
   - Nod and use verbal cues to show you're engaged
   - Reflect back what you've heard to ensure understanding
   - Wait until they finish before responding

2. Use "I" Statements
   - Instead of "You never listen," try "I feel unheard when..."
   - Express feelings without blame
   - Share your perspective clearly
   - Focus on specific situations rather than generalizations
   - Take responsibility for your own emotions

3. Choose the Right Time and Setting
   - Pick a calm moment for important discussions
   - Ensure privacy and minimize distractions
   - Set aside dedicated time for conversations
   - Consider your partner's schedule and energy levels
   - Create a comfortable environment for both parties

4. Show Empathy and Validation
   - Acknowledge your partner's feelings
   - Try to understand their perspective
   - Show that their feelings matter to you
   - Use phrases like "That must be difficult" or "I understand why you feel that way"
   - Avoid dismissing or minimizing their emotions

5. Practice Non-Verbal Communication
   - Be mindful of your body language
   - Match your facial expressions to your words
   - Use appropriate gestures and tone
   - Maintain an open posture
   - Pay attention to your partner's non-verbal cues

6. Handle Conflict Constructively
   - Stay focused on the current issue
   - Avoid bringing up past grievances
   - Take breaks if emotions run high
   - Look for compromise and win-win solutions
   - Focus on the problem, not the person

7. Regular Check-ins
   - Schedule weekly relationship check-ins
   - Share appreciation and gratitude
   - Discuss goals and future plans
   - Address small issues before they grow
   - Celebrate progress and improvements`,
  "Would you like to explore any specific communication technique in more detail?",
  "Remember, good communication takes practice. Which of these areas would you like to work on first?",
  `Here are some common communication pitfalls to avoid:

1. Criticism vs. Complaints
   - Criticism attacks character
   - Complaints address specific behaviors
   - Learn to express needs constructively

2. Defensiveness
   - Listen without immediately defending
   - Take responsibility where appropriate
   - Focus on understanding before responding

3. Stonewalling
   - Recognize when you're overwhelmed
   - Take healthy breaks (20-30 minutes)
   - Return to the conversation when calm

4. Contempt
   - Avoid sarcasm and mockery
   - Build a culture of respect
   - Focus on appreciation`
